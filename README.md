# shreeafk.github.io

This folder contains a minimal static site for deployment to GitHub Pages.

Steps to publish:

1. Create a new *public* repository on GitHub named `shreeafk.github.io` (if it doesn't exist).
2. Push the contents of this folder to the repository root on the `main` branch.
3. After a few minutes, your site will be available at `https://shreeafk.github.io`.

If you'd like, provide a GitHub personal access token and I can create the remote repository and push these files for you.
